The objective of this project was to create a computer application that allows the user to visualize simple orbit transfers between planets and displays relevant information/calculations related to the designed mission. 
The mathematics involved in all calculations are limited to the most basic level of orbital mechanics: two-dimensional transfers between circular orbits.
